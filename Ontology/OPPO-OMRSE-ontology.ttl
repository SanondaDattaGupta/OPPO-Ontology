However, Shaw explicates:
\"In any legal system, certain entities, whether they be individuals or companies, will be regarded as possessing rights and duties enforceable at law. Thus an individual may prosecute or be prosecuted for assault and a company can sue for breach of contract. They are able to do this because the law recognises them as 'legal persons' possessing the capacity to have and to maintain certain rights, and being subject to perform specific duties. (...) In municipal law individuals, limited companies and public corporations are recognized as each possessing a distinct legal personality, the terms of which are circumscribed by the relevant legislation\" (Shaw MN: International Law. Sixth Edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2008).                We hold that Shaw's position is ontological more prolific since it not only allows to explain how groups of individuals become recognized as unities at law, but also how different individuals can hold different legal personality roles (always against the context of one legal system). The latter will proof useful when dealing with the representing comatous patients or minorsat law in ontologies."""@en ;

                obo:IAO_0000116 """BP: The definition summarizes long email discussions on the OBI developer, roles, biomaterial and denrie branches. It leaves open if an organization is a material entity or a dependent continuant, as no consensus was reached on that.  The current placement as material is therefore temporary, in order to move forward with development. Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:

1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch
editor), with individual persons as bearers

2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)

3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles
there are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the
charter/rules/bylaws themselves.

It is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent
continuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the
bearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define
organization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to
all kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.

Interestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place
organization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,
Government Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,
W3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.

This leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -
3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now. We can leave it in its
current place in the is_a hierarchy (material entity) or move it up to
'continuant'. We leave further clarifications to BFO, and close this issue
for now."""@en ;
