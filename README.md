# OPPO: An Ontology for Describing the Fine-Grained Data Practices in Privacy Policies of Online Social Networks

The OPPO: An Ontology for Privacy Policies in Online Social Network is a domain specific ontology that aims at capturing detailed data practices descibed in OSNs' privacy policies. 

The OPPO mailing lists are as follows: sanonda.gupta@maine.edu and torsten.hahmann@maine.edu. 

The development version of OPPO (OPPO_Ontology_Verson1.1.owl (or OPPO_Ontology_Verson1.1.ttl)) imports all ontologies/files present in the OPPO-Ontology/Ontology directory. It includes the following ontologies:

- BFO.owl
- OPPO-IAO-Ontology.ttl
- OPPO-OBI-Ontology.ttl
- OPPO-OMRSE-Ontology.ttl
- dpvo-Ontology.ttl

It is to be noted that,  downloading the OPPO_Ontology_Verson1.1.owl or OPPO_Ontology_Verson1.1.ttl file and opening it through Protege may result in 19000 concepts as it does not try to import the other files which are smaller and only includes concepts which are related to OPPO. 

```To get a better impression of the ontology or to casually explore the core concepts of the OPPO, please refer to the OPPO_Ontology_V1.2_core.ttl.```
